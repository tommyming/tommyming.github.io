### Introduction

Another day in the morning, you opened GitHub and found a interesting repository.

After you look at the content of the repository, you want to start contributing. You saw a lot of issue and pull-requests, so you are searching for **good-first** issue. But seems they still got a quite high difficulty! You feel frustrated and left the repository.

Or should you...?

### What is a "Good-First" Issue?
I think this is the first thing you might search for, in case you are new to a repository. Most of the time, it is one of the best issues to start with.
The issues labeled with "good-first" are issues with very small scope and requirement changes. They are usually easy to understand and implement, making them a great starting point for beginners. When the first-comers come to implement about the issue, they can learn how to contribute to the project and how to use the project's tools and workflow. Sound great and easy to start with, right?

Well, that's a rare case in the software engineering world.

In general, when you take a look at some of the biggest coding repositories (the ones with the most shiny shiny stars), there are tons of "good-first" issue, which are piled with comments or pull requests (or maybe just a bunch of placeholders).

### "Wait, why this "Good-First" Issue soooo difficult?

Depends on the background knowledge of the repository. Some repositories may have complex dependencies or require specific tools to be installed, which can make it difficult for beginners to understand and implement the issue. 

Additionally, some issues may require a deep understanding of the project's architecture or codebase, which can be challenging for beginners to grasp.

E.g. If you are interested to a good-first issue on a lanaguage compiler, it requires a lot of background knowledge, which does make sense.

### Okay, now I know "Good-First" Issue does not exist every time, and some of them are not suitable for beginners. 
### What should I do, if I can't find any "good-first" issue, or the good-first issue is not suitable for me?

Contribute as you like. Raise out an issue that you think is important.
This is always the best way to start contributing to a project. 

No matter if it is just a small correction of the documentation, it is always a good way to start contributing to a project.

If your issue got closed, it is a pretty common thing. Maybe the issue is already fixed, or maybe it is not a good idea to fix/build it.

**Keep Trying is always the key to success.**

Thanks for reading, and hope you will your good-first issue. See you in the next post!
