### About Me (Simple Version)

Hello, This is **Tommy** from Hong Kong.
I am first a **Cat Slave**, a **Street Photographer**, then a **Open-source Lover**, finally a **Software Engineer**.

This blog is originally from [Substack](https://mingtommy.substack.com), but yes I want more freedom and less pressure, I moved to github pages, and use SSG(Static Site Generator) to build this blog.

### Something More
#### What's the articles about?
Well, most of them are about **Mobile Development**, **Open-source**, **Photography**, and **Cats**. But sometimes I may share something about **Software Engineering** and **AI**. (Yeah you know, AI is the future, right? :')

#### Programming Languages?
**Swift** and **Kotlin** are my most comfortable programming languages (When you need to write both OS Apps in Native). 
I do frequently read Swift proposals, sometimes comment, and rarely may contribute. 

Do know some hot-topic lanaguages e.g. **Rust** and **Python**, but mainly for hobby purpose.

Personal Comment: Dislike **Javascript** sometimes.

#### Projects?
**As of Aug 24 2024:**

- Raspberry Pi LocalLLM Implementation + Testing
- Raspberry Pi AI Kit (planning, haven't bought the kit yet)
- Swift Toolchain Manager Study (Mainly on Linux Side)
- Swift Compiler Study
- Ladybird Swift Approach Study

#### What did you do apart from coding in front of the screen?
I indeed do some photos for interest, mainly **Street Photography** and **Urban Photography**.
Sometimes I will show some images here, and sometimes on unsplash.
